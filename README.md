# InstaComm

Hello, I'm Tarık a student in Bilkent CTIS and this is my first public repository. This semester I have started to learn mobile application development and as a term project for three people this project was submitted. The idea came from Burak Aslanbaş which was to generate auto comments for Instagram and the development was done by myself. So, I've decided to put this project to github as a first experience on both the community and the repository.

#### Thank you for having a look.
