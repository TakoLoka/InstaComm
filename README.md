# InstaComm

Hello, I'm TarÄ±k a student in Bilkent CTIS and this is my first public repository. I am studying on Fullstack Web Development but as a hobby I wish to continue Android Application Development. This semester I created this project on my Android Development course. So, I've decided to put this project to github as a first experience on both the community and the repository.

#### Thank you for having a look.
